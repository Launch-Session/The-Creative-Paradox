The Creative Paradox in an original gaming IP that examines the impact of AI on humanity, powered by the very AI technology it aims to explore.

## Intro
The Creative Paradox is a dynamically generated action-adventure game that explores how every creative act affects the fabric of the World. With the power of AI, every action the player takes dynamically changes their surroundings and cast of characters, moment to moment, for better or worse.
The game is designed to give people an engaging, yet challenging, way to wrestle with the notion that AI is a powerful tool for creativity that must be wielded responsibly.

## Dynamic World Building
Your creative or destructive actions shape the protagonist, their world and everyone in it.
Play Hero and Villain at once, transitioning stochastically between good and bad. 

## Every Creation Brings Destruction 

Destruction is a necessary part of gameplay to gather AI energy orbs that power the playerâ€™s creations.
In order to progress you must keep a balance between good and evil actions by using only what you need.
